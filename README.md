### Hi there 👋👋👋

My name is Kenji Tomita. I'm an Android Developer at [Connehito](https://connehito.com/), currently working on [Mamari](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.connehito.mamariq&hl=ja) - an app that solves mom's worries.

I enjoy developing for Android 😁, and I think my favorite thing to talk about is Jetpack Compose.

Thank you for checking out my profile.
Let's hangout on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tommykw_en).
